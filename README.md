# Status: Working
The mod loads and runs perfectly, the recipes are still to be improved when the vanilla ones do
# Early_Mutant
Mod for Cataclysm that adds more accessible recipes for mutagen
## Acquiring
Mutagens can be crafted or found in sewers, labs and in students labs (currently the mutagens do NOT spawn, this is a known issue)
Crafting recipes are also palceholders, in the future they will require different ingredients for each instead of all recquiring the same things
## Currently lacking threshold mutations.
